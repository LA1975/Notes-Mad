# Notes Mad  = a Post It Notes style todo app

## Introduction - why this project
I am wanting to transition from teaching to software development.  Upon completion of PGCert (Information Technology) and I wanted a fullstack project to practice and embedd my newly acquired skills but extend them further to encourage skill growth.

I love stationary and to-do lists and post-it notes


 (I know fun?!?) so when I saw a tutorial on YouTube by codefoxx https://youtu.be/_B-54mvPup4  https://github.com/miguelznunez/Sticky-Notes  I couldn't resist.

This tutorial is just for a simple front-end app and I enjoyed it, however, I soon started to make a list in my head of all the changes and extra features I would like to have in it.

So I decided to create an backend and see how many features I could add.

future ideas:

- incorporate into Kandban board style  
- drag and drop functionality
- ability to change note colour scheme
- make paper look more curled
- keep formating from note textarea
- add labels for note criteria with ability to search/filter by label
- add set due date feature
