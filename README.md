# Notes Mad  - a Post It Notes style todo app

## Introduction - why this project
I am wanting to transition from teaching to software development.  Upon completion of PGCert (Information Technology), I found myself battling cancer and a rare autoimmune disease, dermatomyositis, which put my career change goals on hold.  Not wanting to give up on software development, I wanted a full-stack project to practice and embed my newly acquired skills but extend them further to encourage skill growth.
Notes-Mad is a Node.js application with dependencies that enable the creation and management of notes.

I love all things stationary and to-do lists. So when I saw a tutorial on YouTube by codefoxx https://youtu.be/_B-54mvPup4  https://github.com/miguelznunez/Sticky-Notes  I couldn't resist.

This tutorial is just for a simple front-end app and I enjoyed it, however, I soon started to make a list in my head of all the changes and extra features I would like to have in it.

So I decided to see if I could turn it into a full stack app. [View on replit](https://notes-mad.la1975.repl.co) If you use the replit demo please do not enter authentic information project is public on replit.
